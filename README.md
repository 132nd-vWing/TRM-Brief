### Situation

General situation:
In the period of 2008-2009 tension in the world politics increased. Because of this Georgia turned to the west to increase political, diplomatic and military support in a situation where Russia had increased its military capability and had conducted several military exercises on the borders to Georgia.
In 2009 Turkey and Georgia signed a deal where they established a combined joint training range called Adjara Combined Joint Training Range (ACJTR).
In 2010 the tension increased again, and Georgia invited their allies into Georgia to have, on a regular basis, an enhanced forward presence in order to deter any further Russian aggression. As part of the enhanced forward presence, the 132nd Virtual Wing have deployed to Kutaisi airbase. From time to time additional allied squadrons also deploy to Kutaisi airbase in order to use the facilities at ACJTR and the surrounding ranges.

Adjara Combined Joint Training Range consists of the following airspace (Please see google earth for more details):

CTLD Logistics Script
The following types of units are CTLD units:
Any client Mi-8


CTLD units have the following options available via F10 radio:
1. Loadup Troops at Pickup Zones and unload them anywhere outside any pickup zones (Pickup zones locations see below)
2. Extract any deployed troops and/or JTACs
3. Spawn Cargo Crates for slingload at a Warehouse and assemble crates anywhere outside a Warehouse
4. Deploy Smoke Markers
5. Deploy Radio Beacons (A10, KA50, Huey and Mi-8 can home in on the beacons, all players can use F10 to get a list of active beacions)

Pickupzones (for loading infantry):
1. In the range storages
2. At the apron of Kutaisi
3. At the FARPs

Warehouses (for spawning slingload cargo)
1. Range storages
2. All allied airfields
3. All allied FARPs

Note for CTLD pilots
Once you get in pit, make sure CTLD loaded up correctly for you. Do this simple test: F10 radio options see if CTLD shows up. If no, alternate between pressing F11 (previous) and F10 (other..) CTLD should show up after a few tries.

NOTE: WIP and will be included:
Tankers and AWACS Respawn
All Tankers will RTB when low on fuel or damaged/killed. New tankers will get airborne to ensure constant tanker coverage. Same for AWACS aircraft. See Mission Brief and SPINS for tanker frequencies and TACAN.

RAMROD
Ramrod is an authentication code. RAMROD is a 10 letter word where none of the letters appear twice. To authenticate the challenger selects two letters in the authentication code, one of each side of the desired response. The correct response is the letter bracketed by the challenge. For example using the word COMPLEXIFY, you challenge by saying: Authenticate "PAPA-ECHO" and the reply should be: "I authenticate LIMA"
Standing RAMROD:
-Even days (2,4,6,8 etc): LUMBERJACK
-Odd days (1,3,5,7 etc): COMPLEXITY
