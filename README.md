1. Situation
` 
General situation:
In the period of 2008-2009 tension in the world politics increased. Because of this Georgia turned to the west to increase political, diplomatic and military support in a situation where Russia had incresed its military capability and had conducted several military exercises on the borders to Georgia.

In 2009 Turkey and Georgia signed a deal where they establised a combined joint training range called Adjara Combined Joint Training Range (ACJTR).

In 2010 the tension increased again, and Georgia invited their allies into Georgia to have, on a regular basis, an enhanced forward presence in order to deter any further Russian aggression. As part of the enhanced forward presence, the 132nd Virtual Wing have deployed to Kutaisi airbase. From time to time additional allied squadrons also deploy to Kutaisi airbase in order to use the facilities at ACJTR and the surrounding ranges.
`

Adjara Combined Joint Training Range consists of the following airspace (Please see google earth for more details):

2. SPINS (Special Instructions for aircrew)
Change from EXERCISE to Real world incident
If Russian forces escalate the situation and pose a threat by violating allied airspace, it MAY be required to retask flights from the training, in order to support real operations. IF such a condition happens, the following CODEWORD will be given from AWACS: BARRACUDA.
So, retasking will happen like this:
AWACS: "Flight, BARRACUDA, Call ready for retasking"
Flight: "Copy BARRCUDA, Ready for retasking"



Timings
Timings to be stated in event information.


Standard Units
-Positions will be given in the following format: LAT/LONG. DD°MM.MMM'
-Distance will be given in nautical miles.
-Elevation will be given in feet AMSL unless otherwise stated.

### Air-to-Air specifics
Missile script is activated, so A-A flights can engage with missiles and it will give information about missile launches. DO NOT USE GUNS. Guns should only be simulated.

So, as the missile script is active, it's okay to call fox1,2,3 and actually launch the missile. When hit, you will get a message displayed that you were hit. With that in mind, when you do get hit by a missile, call "This is Metal/Rage XX (number), DEAD, OFF SOUTH" and return to your initial point for another run.

For simulating guns: When the engaging fighter is certain that he can score a gun kill, he calls "Metal/Rage GUNS GUNS GUNS" on his AWACS freq. The AWACS controllers are in contact with each other and will call "Rage/Metal Knock it off, gunkill" at which point the "killed" fighter will return to his initial point for another run. Make sure to state your callsign when calling guns, the controllers can see which aircraft in under attack and will call that aircraft, or, if needed, the flight for the "Knock it off" call.

Please be aware that the controllers can call "Knock it off" at any time should they feel the need. The word "Gunkill" is added to make sure you understand you were shot down.

Flights that are hit by a simulated missile impact (see in game notification), will establish at FL100 or F200, and maintain a steady speed of 200kts, 300kts or 400kts to show that the flight is out of action.
AWACS controller on each side will give a call when flight can respawn and get back into action.


RESTRICTIONS
Air-to-Air: AT NO TIME should guns be used. Only missiles are allowed (Missiles will be destroyed by the missile script, but guns will kill the other asset).

Russian airspace: All allied flights are to stay outside 2nm of the Russian border at all times in order to prevent an unwanted escalation of the situation. NOTE: This is not valid when flighs are tasked by AWACS is to enter Russian airspace in certain situations.

Zone around Russian ships: In order to prevent an unwanted escalation, all flights are to remain 4nm away from any Russian ship.

Force QNH: Any C2 agency (including FAC(A) and SCAR-C can establish a force QNH within his area of responsibility. This in-order to avoid unneccessary QNH changes. When operating on force QNH, the C2 agency need to make sure all assets are briefed on the QNH in use prior to entering the area.

Aerial Refueling
Tanker instructions

Altimeter setting.
Unless otherwise directed an altimeter setting of standard pressure setting (29.92) is to be used for AAR operations.

Vertical separation.
Receivers are to join from below and are to maintain a minimum of 1000ft vertical separation (unless otherwise directed by the controlling agency) , until visual contact have been made.

Clearance.
Receivers must receive clearance from the controlling agency (AWACS) before contacting the tanker.

Joining procedures.
The left side of the tanker is to be used for joining aircraft. The first receiver of a formation may join directly astern the boom, when the receiver has visually confirmed that no refueling is in progress.

Joint Terminal Attack Controllers
JTAC's will use range tactical frequencies (primary or secondary pending situation).


Combat Search and Rescue
CSAR can be conducted in two ways:
-Pre-planned CSAR. If the purpose of the mission is to conduct a rescue operation of a downed pilot
-Immediate CSAR. Occurs if a pilot is shot down during a mission, and AWACS or Air Mission Commander order a CSAR operation to rescue the downed pilot.

CSAR Task force
CSAR Task force can consist of the following assets:
-Recovery asset. Normally a MI-8. If possible one primary and one secondary helicopter.
-Fixed wing rescue escort (RESCORT). Normally A-10s flying overhead pattern to stay close to recovery vehicles.
-Rotary Wing RESCORT. Normally KA-50's flying in formation to the extraction point and will provide fire support at the extraction site.
-Support assets. Tanker and AWACS
-Rescue Combat Air Patrol. Air-to air capable fixed wing aircrafts securing the airspace above the CSAR Area of Operations (AO).

Duties
-Air Mission Commander (AMC). Coordinates the mission as it progresses. Preferably AMC is the AWACS controller. If AWACS is unavailable, AMC will be filled by the role of the most senior flightlead.
-On-Scene Commander(OSC). Coordinates the rescue efforts at the rescue site. Initially this will be the wingman of the downed pilot.

Callsigns
-Rescue Helicopter: PEDRO
-Rescue Escort: SANDY. SANDY 1 will be the On-Scene Commander. If no AWACS is present, SANDY 1 will be both OSC and AMC

MAYDAY call. MAYDAY calls are to be broadcasted at GUARD frequency (243.000). Include Bullseye position (direction and distance from the Bullseye).

If time permits, coordinate with AWACS on flights designated frequency

CSAR Frequency
All CSAR operations are to be conducted on dedicated CSAR frequency. All assets involved in a CSAR operation should monitor this frequency. If several CSAR operations are conducted at the same time, AWACS will designated other frequencies for CSAR.
Primary CSAR frequency is: 228.500 (BROWN 10)

RAMROD
Ramrod is an authentication code. RAMROD is a 10 letter word where none of the letters appear twice. To authenticate the challenger selects two letters in the authentication code, one of each side of the desired response. The correct response is the letter bracketed by the challenge. For example using the word COMPLEXIFY, you challenge by saying: Authenticate "PAPA-ECHO" and the reply should be: "I authenticate LIMA"
Standing RAMROD:
-Even days (2,4,6,8 etc): LUMBERJACK
-Odd days (1,3,5,7 etc): COMPLEXITY

Missile Trainer
Smokey Sam script preventing any anti-aircraft missiles from impacting in the proximity of a player aircraft. When you get in pit you should get this message: "132nd. Missile Trainer is active" . In case you do not see this message, the script is disabled and missiles will be lethal.
The tracking/hit messages can be configured via F10 menu.


CTLD Logistics Script
The following types of units are CTLD units:
Any client Mi-8


CTLD units have the following options available via F10 radio:
1. Loadup Troops at Pickup Zones and unload them anywhere outside any pickup zones (Pickup zones locations see below)
2. Extract any deployed troops and/or JTACs
3. Spawn Cargo Crates for slingload at a Warehouse and assemble crates anywhere outside a Warehouse
4. Deploy Smoke Markers
5. Deploy Radio Beacons (A10, KA50, Huey and Mi-8 can home in on the beacons, all players can use F10 to get a list of active beacions)

Pickupzones (for loading infantry):
1. In the range storages
2. At the apron of Kutaisi
3. At the FARPs

Warehouses (for spawning slingload cargo)
1. Range storages
2. All allied airfields
3. All allied FARPs

Note for CTLD pilots
Once you get in pit, make sure CTLD loaded up correctly for you. Do this simple test: F10 radio options see if CTLD shows up. If no, alternate between pressing F11 (previous) and F10 (other..) CTLD should show up after a few tries.

NOTE: WIP and will be included:
Tankers and AWACS Respawn
All Tankers will RTB when low on fuel or damaged/killed. New tankers will get airborne to ensure constant tanker coverage. Same for AWACS aircraft. See Mission Brief and SPINS for tanker frequencies and TACAN.
